          ✔️ The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. <br />
          ✔️In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes.
          Each result get added to his CURRENT ROUND score. <br />
          ✔️But, if the player rolls a 1, all his CURRENT ROUND score gets
          lost.After that, it's the next player's turn. <br />
          ✔️The player can choose to "HOLD",which means that his CURRENT ROUND
          score gets added to his OVERALL SCORE.After that it's next player's
          turn. <br />
          ✔️If your OVERALL SCORE reaches the WINNING SCORE (300), then you
          win!!
